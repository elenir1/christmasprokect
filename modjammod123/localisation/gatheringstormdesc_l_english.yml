 FPE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Flimsypikean was the victor of the first Modjam war. But this wasn't the end of the troubles for the empire. Due to the traumas of the war, the nation adopted the "No more brother wars" policy, which closed military factories, weakened the army and established the Flimsypikean Empire as a neutral nation. The workers saw their jobs taken away and began to rebel, the revolution was contained, but the damaged it caused were not. The nation was placed in an economic crisis after losing so much infrastructure, manpower and factories. The country has been struggling to repair their economy, and the Kebban Republic is rearming. Could this lead to the end of the Flimsypikean Empire"
 CRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the civil war in 1923, the Crusno Horde has remained a largely estable and undeveloped country, with a lot of politcal purging and other inhumane acts. Now that Kebb has returned to the Kebban Republic, they could seek to ally Kebb. This would also mean that the Crusno Horde will finally be superpower in the continent. The Crusno horde is now between 2 choices, will it finally collapse or will it become the empire it always wanted?"
