 CRN_Legacyofthegreatpurge:0 "Legacy Of The Great Purge"
 CRN_Legacyofthegreatpurge_desc:0 "The great purge was our effort in 1916 to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements in our society, with the main target being the people who voted against us in the false elections. Our army rebelled too and a civil war errupted in the country. We managed to win the civil war in 1923, at the cost of many of our young men dying in the war. The population to this day still fears the government, with the amount of innocent blood it has spilled over the years."
